In addition to this file itself, this archive file contains
the following files.


I. Java Source Code, some of which are templates you must finish.

Node.java (needs coding)
ConnectedComponent.java  (needs no more coding, but calls a node method
                          clearAddedToAuxList that you must provide)
Graph.java (needs coding)
GCPPart2Driver.java (you should modify this to call the 
                     Graph methods you implement)

Point.java  (does not need coding)
Turtle.java (does not need coding)
GenGraph.java - a tool to generate test data files


II. The ImplementationNotes.txt file discusses the algorithms.

III. Testing Materials for comparing your output to mine

for n = 1, 2, 4, 7, 40, 41

gcIn.txt  - input file for the program
gcOn.txt  - capture of output to standard out from running the
            driver on gcIn.txt, augmented with additional output
            that should be useful for debugging;  your submission
            should not produce all of that output, just the final
            color assignment results;

for N = 1, 2, 7, 40

gcNLF.jpg  - capture of the Turtle image for the LF algorithm for
              gcIN.txt
gcNSL.jpg  - capture of the Turtle image for the SL algorithm for
              gcIN.txt
gcNSLI.jpg - capture of the Turtle image for the SLI algorithm for
              gcIN.txt
gcNRLF.jpg - capture of the Turtle image for the RLF algorithm for
              gcIN.txt

except for gcI1.txt, the first three algorithms all produce the same
coloring, so there is one image file for the three

gc1LFSLSLI.jpg


The image file sizes may be a little different from yours, but the coloring should
be clear and match the results our solution produces.

gcI4 has 2000 nodes
gcI41 has 41 nodes

so neither produced any Turtle images.

IV. the manualExamples.txt file shows how the algorithms work on a couple of
    simple graphs
